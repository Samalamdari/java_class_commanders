    Activity: Implementing Hierarchical Inheritance

    Task 1: Design a class structure representing different staff members in a school.

    Start with a general class Staff with properties like name, designation, and a method displayDetails().
    Create a specific class Teacher that extends Staff and introduces new methods, such as teachSubject().
    Create another class Janitor derived from Staff, introducing methods like cleanClassroom().

    Task 2: Instantiate objects for Teacher and Janitor. Call the displayDetails() method (from Staff) and the unique methods
    from each derived class (like teachSubject() and cleanClassroom()). What output do you expect?
